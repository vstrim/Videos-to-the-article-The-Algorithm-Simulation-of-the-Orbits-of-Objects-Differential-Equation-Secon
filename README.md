In this paper we consider the algorithm for calculation of motion of bodies, using the coherent graph. The graph is built through solving a differential equation of second order curves, using theorem of the center of mass and transition from a consecutive number of relative coordinates to general system of coordinates. We consider also some problems of the origin of body rotation under the influence of the thermal radiation from the second body.
